* Academic Uses of Ontotext GraphDB

[[http://graphdb.ontotext.com][Ontotext GraphDB]] has a Free edition that only has a limit on the number of concurrent queries.
People tell us that they like the developer and user-friendliness of the database, especially the GraphDB Workbench.
As a result, it's used widely in academic research.

GraphDB Free collects usage statistics (you can opt out of that), but I don't believe we have analyzed it systematically.
Another way to analyze where it is used is to research the literature.

* GraphDB on Wikipedia
I started a Wikipedia table entry about GraphDB:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Graph_database#Ontotext_GraphDB.
As part of that, in Dec 2018 I did some analysis and saw that is used in a wide variety of domains, eg:
social media analytics, data marketplaces, engineering, life sciences, medicine, chemistry, art history vocabularies, Holocaust research, etc.

* Sources

Here are some sources of references, refreshed as of Dec 2019:
- [[https://scholar.google.bg/scholar?q=ontotext+graphdb+OR+owlim][Google Scholar]] (search for "ontotext graphdb OR owlim"): about 1000-1200 academic papers that mention it (research articles, theses, etc). 
  I checked the [[https://scholar.google.bg/scholar?start=990&q=ontotext+graphdb+OR+owlim][page starting at result 990]] and although most of those 10 papers are not in English (I hit Spanish, German, French and Catalonian),
  I was able to verify that all of them mention it.
  There is some duplication, but even assuming this represents 700 unique academic papers, that's still very impressive.
- [[https://www.google.com/search?q=ontotext+graphdb%2520OR%2520owlim&tbm=bks][Google Books]] (search for "ontotext graphdb OR owlim"): it's hard to say how many of these hits actually mention it since Google Books search uses some associative algorithm.
  But I checked the first 5 pages and it seems most of those 50 books mention it.
- [[https://news.google.com/search?q=ontotext][Google News]] (search for "Ontotext", not Ontotext GraphDB): this is harder to judge, because:
  - It includes many company press releases
  - It seems to index not only the text of news items, but also header/footer text.
    Eg the news item [[https://commercegazette.com/2019/12/09/automatic-identification-and-data-capture-aidc-market-worth-100-5-billion-by-2025-datalogic-honeywell-zebra-technologies-sick-cognex-sato-denso-wave-cipherlab-2/][Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) Market worth $100.5 billion by 2025-Datalogic, Honeywell, Zebra Technologies, Sick, Cognex, Sato, Denso Wave, Cipherlab]]
    is not related to Ontotext, except that it mentions the item 
    [[https://commercegazette.com/2019/12/09/semantic-knowledge-discovery-software-market-research-2019-key-players-maanachemaxonexpert-system-spaontotextcollexis-elseviercambridge-semanticsnervana-intel/][Semantic Knowledge Discovery Software Market Research 2019: Key Players- MAANA,ChemAxon,Expert System SpA,OntoText,Collexis (Elsevier),Cambridge Semantics,Nervana (intel)]] at the bottom.

* Zotero Bibliography

I started a Zotero bibliography [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2272261/ontotext/items/collectionKey/3XWCS346][Groups > Ontotext > Library > Papers Mentioning GraphDB]] that is currently closed 
and includes only 132+14 papers (132 by external authors and 14 by Ontotext authors).
If you are interested, we could open the library and add more of the Google Scholar papers to it.

* WordCloud

Here is a word-cloud of applications of Ontotext GraphDB in academic papers, based on the Topics shown in the next section

- I used [[http://WordClouds.com][WordClouds.com]] to generate this cloud
- [[./graphdb-wordCloud.txt]] uses "~" instead of space as separator to make the tool treat phrases not words
- Configuration saved as: [[./ontotext-graphdb-applications.wcld]] (CloudConfig v3.5.3)
- Use ~File> Open Text File~ and load the above file. It represents the following settings:
  - ~File> Paste/Type text~: paste [[./graphdb-wordCloud.txt]]
  - Size: 800x800
  - Gap size: 2
  - Direction of words: uphill/horizontal/downhill
  - Shape> shapes: christmas tree
  - Mask: checked
  - Theme: 4-th one with 6 colors
- Colors> background> Color: select a dark green
  - Font: Verdana
  - Font size (slider above the wordlet): 51 (to fill out the tree shape in a good way)
