[Ontotext GraphDB](http://graphdb.ontotext.com) is not open source, 
but it has a Free edition that only has a limit on the number of concurrent queries.
And people tell us that they like the developer and user-friendliness of the database, especially the GraphDB Workbench.
As a result, it's used widely in academic research.

GraphDB Free collects usage statistics (you can opt out of that), but I don't believe we have analyzed it systematically.
Another way to analyze where it is used is to research the literature.

I started a Wikipedia table entry about GraphDB:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Graph_database#Ontotext_GraphDB.
As part of that, I saw that is used in a wide variety of domains, eg:
social media analytics, data marketplaces , engineering, 
life sciences, medicine, chemistry, art history vocabularies, Holocaust research, etc.

Checked the first 10-15, all of them do
- [[https://news.google.com/search?q=ontotext][Google Scholar]]: shows about 250 research articles that mention it

Here is a word-cloud on applications of Ontotext GraphDB.
These are phrases describing the application domain, so they exclude phrases 
such as semantic, querying, annotation, etc.

- [[./graphdb-wordCloud.txt]] is a list of 95 phrases extracted from the first 150 papers on Google Scholar
- [[./graphdb-wordCloud1.txt]] uses "~" instead of space as separator to make the tool treat phrases not words
- I used [[http://WordClouds.com][WordClouds.com]] to generate this cloud, with settings:
  Size: 3000x3000, Gap size: 2, Direction of words: uphill/horizontal/downhill, Shape: square, Colors: (as many as possible), Font: Verdana.

Hopefully in the future I'll add some more info, eg a Zotero bibliography.
If you have some needs or ideas, post an issue or a pull request!
