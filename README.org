* Diverse Uses of Ontotext GraphDB

[[http://graphdb.ontotext.com][Ontotext GraphDB]] has a Free edition that only has a limit on the number of concurrent queries.
People tell us that they like the developer and user-friendliness of the database, especially the GraphDB Workbench.
As a result, it's used widely in academic research.

GraphDB Free collects usage statistics (you can opt out of that), but I don't believe we have analyzed it systematically.
Another way to analyze where it is used is to research the literature.

** GraphDB on Wikipedia
I started a Wikipedia table entry about GraphDB:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Graph_database#Ontotext_GraphDB.
As part of that, in Dec 2018 I did some analysis and saw that is used in a wide variety of domains, eg:
social media analytics, data marketplaces, engineering, life sciences, medicine, chemistry, art history vocabularies, Holocaust research, etc.

** ENDORSE Conference

A version of this work was presented as:
- Vladimir Alexiev, [[https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/ontotext-graphdb-applications/raw/master/Diverse%2520Uses%2520of%2520a%2520Semantic%2520Graph%2520Database%2520for%2520Knowledge%2520Organization%2520and%2520Research%2520(ENDORSE%25202021).pptx][Diverse Uses of a Semantic Graph Database for Knowledge Organization and Research]],
  European Data Conference on Reference Data and Semantics (ENDORSE 2021), 16-19 March 2021.
  Organized by the EU Publications Office and the ISA2 Programme
- Abstract: Semantic Graph Databases are the foundation of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs. They are used in numerous industrial applications, but also Knowledge Organization Management systems (thesaurus and ontology management systems), such as VocBench, SWC PoolParty, Synaptica Semaphore. Through VocBench, semantic databases manage or publish some of the most important thesauri: EuroVoc, AgroVoc, the Getty Vocabularies, etc. Semantic databases are also used in a wide variety of research domains and projects. Some have open source or free editions that make them an easy choice for academic research. We searched on Google Scholar and found 1000-1200 academic papers and theses mentioning one of the popular databases. We also found at least 50 books on Google Books that mention it. We started a Zotero bibliography on the topic (currently about 150 papers), and captured about 220 research topics, based on the titles of about 250 papers. We will present an analysis of reference data and research domains using a semantic database. Some of the traditional topics include: social media analytics, data marketplaces, business process management, enterprise data integration, statistical data, engineering, smart cities, sensor networks, life sciences, biomedical ontologies, medicines, chemistry, linguistic data, semantic publishing, semantic text analysis, geographic information, master data management. Newer or more exotic topics include academic/research data, COVID and Zika viruses, Quran and bilingual Arabic-English data, art history, Holocaust research, musical events and adaptations, iconography, food and drink, tourism, investment decision support, economic research, offshore leaks, maritime data, construction projects, building information management, crisis management, critical incidents and infrastructures, data journalism, clinical trials and specific medical topics (e.g. intestinal cells, intracoronal tooth restorations, vaccines, toxicology), investment recommendations, data journalism, etc.

* Zotero Bibliography

I started a Zotero bibliography [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2744757/ontotext-graphdb][Ontotext GraphDB]] that as of 1-Mar-2021 includes [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2744757/ontotext-graphdb/library][175 papers]] mentioning GraphDB:

[[./img/zotero-graphdb.png]]

It includes the following categories:

** Sources

Here are some sources of references, refreshed as of Dec 2019:
- [[https://scholar.google.bg/scholar?q=ontotext+graphdb+OR+owlim][Google Scholar]] (search for "ontotext graphdb OR owlim"): about 1000-1200 academic papers that mention it (research articles, theses, etc). 
  I checked the [[https://scholar.google.bg/scholar?start=990&q=ontotext+graphdb+OR+owlim][page starting at result 990]] and although most of those 10 papers are not in English (I hit Spanish, German, French and Catalonian),
  I was able to verify that all of them mention it.
  There is some duplication, but even assuming this represents 700 unique academic papers, that's still very impressive.
- [[https://www.google.com/search?q=ontotext+graphdb%2520OR%2520owlim&tbm=bks][Google Books]] (search for "ontotext graphdb OR owlim"): it's hard to say how many of these hits actually mention it since Google Books search uses some associative algorithm.
  But I checked the first 5 pages and it seems most of those 50 books mention it.
- [[https://news.google.com/search?q=ontotext][Google News]] (search for "Ontotext", not Ontotext GraphDB): this is harder to judge, because:
  - It includes many company press releases
  - It seems to index not only the text of news items, but also header/footer text.
    Eg the news item [[https://commercegazette.com/2019/12/09/automatic-identification-and-data-capture-aidc-market-worth-100-5-billion-by-2025-datalogic-honeywell-zebra-technologies-sick-cognex-sato-denso-wave-cipherlab-2/][Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) Market worth $100.5 billion by 2025-Datalogic, Honeywell, Zebra Technologies, Sick, Cognex, Sato, Denso Wave, Cipherlab]]
    is not related to Ontotext, except that it mentions the item 
    [[https://commercegazette.com/2019/12/09/semantic-knowledge-discovery-software-market-research-2019-key-players-maanachemaxonexpert-system-spaontotextcollexis-elseviercambridge-semanticsnervana-intel/][Semantic Knowledge Discovery Software Market Research 2019: Key Players- MAANA,ChemAxon,Expert System SpA,OntoText,Collexis (Elsevier),Cambridge Semantics,Nervana (intel)]] at the bottom.
